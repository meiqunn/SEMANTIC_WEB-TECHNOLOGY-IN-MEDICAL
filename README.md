Objective:This project focuses on developing a robust sentiment analysis system tailored for the social media domain. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret user-generated content on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. By processing large volumes of textual data, the system can detect and classify sentiments—such as positive, negative, or neutral—expressed in posts, comments, and reviews.
